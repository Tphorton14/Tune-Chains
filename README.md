Tune Chains is a music project repository and version control application. The application manages and stores revisions of music projects whether uploaded by the user, or imported from other music websites such as spotify or wave-based music editing application.  Whether imported or directly uploaded by the user, each song is designated as a parent song.  Users are then allowed to branch/fork each song with their own version or remix.  The application makes the searching, upload, and remixing process easy and seamless.  The application during this process tags each song as a parent or a child song. Child songs, remixes, are tracked throughout the parent/child creation.  Within each user song library the parent songs and their children are displayed, and any songs that are remixed by other users are given a parent ID tag to keep track of all music that is copied and remixed.

The overall goal of the application is to easily allow copying of music files while maintaining a tracking mechanism that identifies root parents of all remixed songs.
